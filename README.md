### Hi there
I obtained a master's degree in Language Technology from Uppsala University.
I work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), with a focus on Natural Language Generation such as Question Answering (QA) and dialogue systems, Multilingual NLP, information retrieval and extraction, as well as recommendation systems. I am keen to create accessible, robust resources and tools for human languages by leveraging programming languages and artificial intelligence. In addition, I am interested in exploring different applications of NLP and ML on other domains, such as mental healthcare and literature.

üî≠ Working on

Many things! Either for my own curiousity or to create tools that will help others in different aspects. Mostly working on models and tools in NLP, neural search, QA, and generative models.

ü§ù Collaboration

I'm open to collaborate on research and projects regarding NLP or ML :) Feel free to reach out to me!
